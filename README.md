# Jarvis- AI Virtual Desktop Assistant
 
###### Virtual Desktop Assistant Project in Python
Jarvis is a `Virtual Desktop Assistant`.The basic functioning of the application is based on the fact that it understands natural language voice commands and completes tasks for the user.
Below are the functionalities that are at present, in a working condition:-
- Opening **Wikipedia** on command and speaking 2 sentences about the arguement passed.
- Opening **YouTube** on command.
- Opening **Google** on command.
- Opening **Spotify** on command.
- Opening **Reddit** on command.
- Playing Music on commmand as per the directory's location in the local storage.
- Opening **Visual Studio Code** on command.
- Sending E-Mails on command.

The E-Mail functionality is not recommended to be used as it is unsafe to provide access to your E-Mail credentials to **Less Secure Applications**. For using this functionality, please refer to [This Article](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en).

This project was made with the help of a [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k9CphTdnWE&list=PLK8cqdr55Tss0puRoHDBagvj7Qjin9axl&index=33) by a YouTube channel, [Programming With Harry](https://www.youtube.com/c/ProgrammingWithHarry). Grateful to have him together while coding the application.

New functionalities might be added to the application in the future. The code would be commented soon as well.
